Notes

I have igrated to onenote

What I did when I stopped:
When changing tile: Why is multiple baots spawned and script of old boet keeps running for a bit, but destroyimmidietely is bad

Make rock with probuilder. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUSOg5YEflM


Working on go to main menu
Trying to make escape menu work. Add dontdesteyonload to canvas again!
Tried to make saving to file work. Gave up on that for now

Goal = hole, fall through to next level. (iterator would need to be 3D). Menu with holes so you fall to what you choose. Boat follows mouse cursor? 

Make version of game controller that starts at level n, so you can choose starting level from menu
Continue button starts from reached level?

All text verdana?
